# library
The original Project Odin assignment for library:
  
   Make a website where users can track the books they own. List each book's title, author, page number, and whether the user has read it. Allow the users to add/delete books and change their read status. (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)

Subsequent Project Odin stipulation:

    Refactor the code to use the class constructor style. (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-classes)

Class constructor style is in script.js. The original code is in script2.js.
