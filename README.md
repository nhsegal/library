# Library
My submission for The Odin Project's [library assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).
The student is asked to make a website where users can track the books they own. The web app must be list each book's title, author, page number, and whether the user has read it. It must also allow the users to add/delete books and change their read status. 

[Subsequent Project Odin stipulation](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-classes): Refactor the code to use the class constructor style. 

My script in class constructor style is in `script.js`. The original code is in `script2.js`. Either produces the same result, which is [here](https://nhsegal.github.io/library/).
